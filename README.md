## [Installation](#table-of-contents)

  To use this app on your localhost:
  clone the start code from the repo. Then run `npm install` in the command line/terminal to install the needed dependencies. This app utilizes express, npm uuid and path.

  Otherwise no installation should be needed to use from the webpage.

## [Usage](#table-of-contents)
  
  Upon opening the app, you will be presented with a landing page. After clicking the get started button, the app will load the notes page. On the left hand side is a list of all notes while the right side is for entering them. You need to provide a title and body text for your note, afterwards clicking the save icon (a floppy disk) will add the note to the list on the left. The plus (+) sign is to create a new note.

  Currently the delete function is not set up, I plan to add this functionality in the future.
